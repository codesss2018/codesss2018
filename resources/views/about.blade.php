    <h2 class="text-red-text">about us</h2>
    <p class="para">CODE-S is a nonprofit that is dedicated to providing a platform for the training and orientation of individuals in the field of computers and computer programming. Our vision is to reach anyone anywhere in the country with computer orientation and empower them to apply basic computing skills in their daily lives and at work. A little survey around would inform one that most people are computer illiterates, even suprisingly enough most students and graduates. Seeing as how the entire world is moving into digitization and more computing intesive trends, we are interested in making sure that our country and even Africa as a whole is not left behind. We believe that increase in computer literacy this would help the world move closer to the attainment of sustainable development goal 9 which focuses on Building  resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation.</p>
    <p class="para">To acheive this, We aim to work hand in hand with educational institutions, industries and tech companies in order to expand the reach of computers and programming nationwide. We also partner with organizations with similar goals world wide, to benefit from their experience and expertize. We do believe that anyone from anywhere can learn anything, hence our range of students is everybody and as such we are committed to also encourage everyone and inspire them to learn something about computers. </p>
